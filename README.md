# Breach_Reports

Read more details in this Notion blog post: 

This repository covers data collection and data processing, exploratory data analysis, and data
visualization.

Data itself represents breach reports from the Office for Civil Rights website. (https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf)

In this portfolio project I performed comprehensive data analysis to gain insights into the nature of these breaches. These reports provided valuable information on various types of breaches, including their causes and impacted entities. The goal of the project was to understand the most common types of breaches and identify trends that could contribute to better data security practices. 

The final visualizations are presented in 2 ways: 
1. PowerBI files (file extension: .pbix),
2. Jupyter Notebook files, which include the coding part (file extension: .ipynb).
